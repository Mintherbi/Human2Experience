# Human 2 Experience

## 1. Project Aim
This is code that I used for my graduate thesis project. In this project, I have introduced a mathematical model to analyze human experiences. This model considers various factors through which people perceive and interact with their environment, such as vision, physical stamina, energy expenditure, and heart rate. These variables are crucial in understanding the depth of space visible from a person's perspective and the slope of the terrain they are walking on.

By quantifying these elements, my model provides a detailed analysis of how different environmental conditions impact human experience. For instance, the depth of space visible to a person can influence their sense of openness or enclosure, affecting their comfort and navigation within the area. Similarly, the slope of the terrain can impact physical exertion and energy consumption, influencing the ease or difficulty of movement.

Through this approach, I aim to design environments that are not only functional but also enhance the well-being and comfort of their users. By considering the physiological and perceptual responses of individuals, my design can cater to the needs of the people who use these spaces daily. This integration of human-centric data into the design process allows me to create more inclusive, accessible, and enjoyable environments.

In this project, rather than focusing solely on creating traditionally 'good' spaces, my primary goal has been to provide diverse experiences for individuals as they walk through these environments. I recognize that perceptions of a 'good' space can vary greatly depending on personal backgrounds and preferences. Therefore, my approach has been to enrich the walking experience by considering a wide range of factors that influence human perception and comfort. By doing so, I aim to create environments that offer varied and engaging experiences, catering to a broader spectrum of individual needs and enhancing the overall interaction with the space.
